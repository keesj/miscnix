The scripts in this directory perform an automated install of
MINIX R3.2.0 on a qemu instance. it "uses" the qemu curses
feature to screen scape the display and use the expect program
to interact with the system.

The main goal currently is to perform an automated install
for test automation purposes.

Dependencies:
	expect
	qemu-kvm
Targets:
  minix.base.8g.img to download and create a basic installation 
                       of the system.

  minix.postinst.8g.img to create an up-to-date image based on the
                        base image that will have a few issues fix
			ed and a password set.

  Getting to an "up-to-date" installation still requires you to copy
the post-install.sh script to the MINIX instance and run it.

It will 
* checkout the most recent versions of pkgsrc and the MINIX 3
* build a new clang with shared libraries support
* install the newest sources using make clean/world.

After that you can start the image using the startup.sh command
in this directory can be use to start the image. I usually use the
following ~/.ssh/config
#
Host minix
HostName localhost
User root
Port 2222


@TODO:
* Improve the expect scipt to allow passing of arguments.
* Add some automated tests for the fun of it.
* Add more testing
* The current system currently uses the qemu curses to interact 
with. way better would be to make the serial line the main 
console. I did not figure out how to do this in the kernel and 
bootloader.
