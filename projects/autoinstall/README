The scripts in this directory perform an automated install of
MINIX R3.2.0 on a qemu instance. it "uses" the qemu curses
feature to screen scape the display and use the expect program
to interact with the system.

The main goal currently is to perform an automated install
for test automation purposes.

Running:
	type make

After that you can start the image using 
	qemu -hda minix.base.8g.img


@TODO:
* Improve the expect scipt to allow passing of arguments.
* Perform automated building of system packages. The image is 
currently 8G and this is large enough to install pkgsrc
* Add some automated tests for the fun of it.
* Add more testing
* The current system currently uses the qemu curses to interact 
with. way better would be to make the serial line the main 
console. I did not figure out how to do this in the kernel and 
bootloader.
