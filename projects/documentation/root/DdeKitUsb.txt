Information about MINIX 3 USB support
======================================

We are using the driver portability layer called
link:http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/ddekit/[Device Driver Environment kit] to
provide support for USB host on the MINIX 3 operating system. The Device Driver
Environment was developed for reuse of legacy device drivers. It defines an
operating system agnostic kernel application programming interface (API) and
provides Linux 2.6.29 based legacy drivers for supporting USB-host among other
things. DDE with USB host support has been ported to MINIX 3 by Dirk Vogd.


Functional decomposition
------------------------


DdeKit
~~~~~~~

DDEKIT provides a BSD licensed abstraction layer for driver development. This
abstraction, defined in includes files, defines the following primitives: data
types, memory allocation, paging, threading, semaphores, timers, low level
hardware I/O, requesting interrupts and dma access. It is located inside the
MINIX3 source tree at /usr/src/minix/include/ddekit and implemented in
/usr/src/minix/lib/libddekit.


Dde-linux26
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dde-linux26 is a GPLv2 package that uses ddekit host Linux device drivers.
Using ddekit it replaces key parts of the Linux device driver model to be able
to run drivers on a non Linux kernel. It contains large parts of the Linux
2.6.29 source code in the contrib directory and provide abstractions for a the
following type of drivers: common, block, common, net, partitions, scsi and usb.
This code only depends on ddekit and is not MINIX 3 specific.

Dde-linux26-usb-drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Dde-linux26-usb-drivers use dde-linux26 to implement an USB stack for MINIX.


USB host controller driver (USBD)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The USB host controller driver is a MINIX 3 service that talks to the USB host
controller hardware using established standards like EHCI and OHCI and mediates
access to USB devices by implementing a virtual host controller driver.


UsbStubDriver::
	For new device notification
UsbHostControllerDriver::
	MINIX bus driver implementation using usbcore
USBCORE::
	Linux library to implement host controllers
EHCI::
	Standard way of talking to the usb host controller
DDELinux::
	the support library for things like platform_device creation 



USB class driver (mass storage/hid)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The USB drivers in MINIX3 will communicates with USB devices host controller
over a virtual host controller interface provided by USBD. The class drivers
uses the DDE kit and Linux drivers like SCSI to implement Their service.


UsbClassStorage::
	implements a minix interface like block device 
DDE helpers::
	helpers like the  SCSI lib part in case of the USB mass storage class 
VHCI::
	Virtual host controller as also used to provide usb over ethernet. This
	driver talks to USBD using grants and messages. 


Device manager (DEVMAN)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Devman is a device manager who's main goal is to enable hot-plugging of
hardware. Based on events from USBD and a configuration file it will create
device nodes and start or stop USB class drivers.

There are two parts to devman. One is a MINIX3 service and the second one is a userland daemon. 


Startup sequence for mass storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The initialization is as follow

* The RC script starts the devman
* The RC script start devmand
* devmand read it's configuration and starts listening for events from devman
* Usbd is started via the extended RC scripts that look in /usr/pkg/etc/rc.d.
* The stub driver inside usbd notifies devman about new usb devices found
* devman exports this information over sysfs and devmand reads about a new
  configurations
* devman starts the mass_storage service based on it's configuration
* the mass_storage service binds to the interface over the virtual host 
  controller
* After some time the device is ready to be mounted.

Shutdown sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The shutdown sequence is the following
* umount usb file systems
* stop devmand ( also stops the running services like usb_storage)
* stop usbd
* umount /sys
* stop devman


Running and developing
----------------------

The device manager is located in the MINIX 3 sources but the remaining components are lotacted outside of this source tree and are referred from the pkgsrc tree. To get the code working it should be enough to reboot after having gone to /usr/pkgsrc/minix/dde-linux26-usb-drivers and and ran bmake install.

To develop you might need we suggest your first run bmake install and after that run bmake build-env in either the de-linux26-usb-drivers or dde-linux26 directory. running bmake && bmake install will directly install the libraries in the correct location.

The code for dde-linux26 and dde-linux26-usb-driver is hosted on git.minix3.org
